### Task
Company has diff sizes servers. To load balance jobs across the servers, 
each job is assigned to random a server such that if server X is three times 
as big as server Y, then server X gets assigned three times as often as server Y.
So server X would be assigned approximately 75% of the time and server Y 
would be assigned 25% of the time.
